# Payroll Batch Job

This project is a small snippet of a payroll batch job with supporting classes and dependencies.

## Questions/Tasks:
1. Find the BatchJobService class and read through the code.  Tell us what you think this code does?
2. Refactor the code to make sure it compiles.
3. Refactor the code as you wish (change anything) to make it more clear, more reusable.
4. Add anything to the code that would make this "production ready" and more complete.
